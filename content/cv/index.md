## Introduction

<!-- NOTE: Copy section from themes/tempest/layouts/_default/home.html and content/_index.md. -->

Hey. I'm Charlie, a software engineer based in London. I'm currently a senior product engineer at
[incident.io](https://incident.io), helping companies like <em>Airbnb</em> and <em>Netflix</em> to
improve their incident management process.

Previously, I led product development at [vidsy.co](https://vidsy.co) as the CTO, helping companies
like _L'Oréal_ and _Activision_ scale to produce thousands of video ads per year.

Before that, I helped shape the digital experience at [bbc.com/news](https://bbc.co.uk/news) for
reporting on elections as a senior engineer.

Outside of work, you'll likely find me climbing or up a mountain.
