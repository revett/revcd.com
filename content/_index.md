I'm currently a senior product engineer at [incident.io](https://incident.io), helping companies
like _Airbnb_ and _Netflix_ to improve their incident management process.

Previously, I led product development at [vidsy.co](https://vidsy.co) as the CTO, helping companies
like _L'Or√©al_ and _Activision_ scale to produce thousands of video ads every year.

Before that, I helped shape the digital experience at [bbc.com/news](https://bbc.co.uk/news) for
reporting on elections, as a senior engineer.

Outside of work, you'll likely find me climbing or up a mountain.
