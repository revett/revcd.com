# Hiking Bobotov Kuk - Sedlo to Žabljak GPX Routes

> _By **@Charlie Revett** on August 26, 2023_

Eight friends and I rented a Renault Trafic from Dubrovnik this summer, and travelled along the
Croatian coast, up through Bosnia, and then back down through Montenegro. One of the highlights was
a day hike in Montenegro’s [Durmitor National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durmitor); where
we set off from Sedlo at 7am, summited [Bobotov Kuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobotov_Kuk)
(2523m) at around 10am, and then hiked back down to Žabljak, finishing with beer and a swim in the
[Black Lake](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lake_(Montenegro)>) (Crno Jezero) at around 4pm.

This is a quick post to share my GPX routes, as I struggled to find easily accessible free downloads
before the trip. Overall the route is very well signposted, and the Sedlo to summit part of the hike
was busy as it’s a relatively easy 5 hour out and back tourist route. However, the summit to Žabljak
portion of the day was harder to navigate, and we only met a handful of other hikers on the descent.
Hope these help, and enjoy! This ended up being one of my favourite day hikes I’ve done so far.
